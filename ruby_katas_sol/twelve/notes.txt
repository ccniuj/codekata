how would I implement it:
  * top 10 selling products for last 24 hrs, updated every hour
  * in a delayed job, run sql to get top 10 products
  * something like this:
      SELECT p.id, count(*) count
      FROM line_items items
      INNER JOIN products p ON items.product_id = p.id
      GROUP BY p.id
      ORDER BY count DESC
      LIMIT 10;
  * store top 10 products ids in redis sorted set?

only update the list once per day:
  * easy, change resque schedule

update in real time:
  * don't think redis makes sense anymore
  * run the sql every time? seems slow
  * add purchase counter to deal row? and run simpler query?
    * SELECT id, count(*)
      FROM products
      ORDER BY count DESC
      LIMIT 10;
